# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: predictify-transaction-interface 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID/improve

**Description**: Build this interface

This interface appears to be a form for processing or predicting the details of a transaction involving a product. Here's a detailed breakdown of its sections and layout:

Top Section
Endpoint: A text box labeled "Endpoint" where a specific endpoint identifier (e.g., hw-red-panda-123456) is entered.
Monitor DataLayer: A checkbox labeled "Monitor DataLayer" which, when checked, presumably enables monitoring of data layers for the transaction.
Customer: A text box labeled "Customer" for entering customer information or an identifier.
Reset: A button labeled "Reset" to clear or reset the form to its initial state.
Product Information
Product Table: A table that lists the product details with the following columns:
Product: Displays the SKU and name of the product (e.g., SKU-4577-736 Sneakers).
Qty: Quantity of the product (e.g., 1).
Price: Price of the product (e.g., 123456).
Discount: Discount applied to the product (e.g., 4568).
Transaction Details
Shipping: A field to enter the shipping cost or details.
Handling: A field to enter handling fees or details.
Payment: A field to enter payment-related costs or details.
Other Discounts: A field to enter any additional discounts not specified in the product table.
Financial Summary
Revenue: A field to display or enter the total revenue from the transaction.
Cost: A field to display or enter the total cost associated with the transaction.
Transaction Types
Type: Dropdown menus to select the type of services or methods for:
Shipping (e.g., AIRMEE)
Handling (e.g., DEFAULT)
Payment (e.g., KLARNA)
Action Button
Predict: A button labeled "Predict" to execute a prediction or calculation based on the entered details.
Layout
The interface is divided into distinct sections for clarity:
Top Section for endpoint and customer details.
Product Information in a tabular format for listing products, quantities, prices, and discounts.
Transaction Details and Financial Summary fields for additional costs and financial data.
Transaction Types for specifying the types of services or methods involved.
Action Button at the bottom to trigger the prediction or calculation.
This layout allows users to enter detailed information about a transaction, including product specifics, financial details, and service types, and then predict or process the transaction using the provided "Predict" button.
